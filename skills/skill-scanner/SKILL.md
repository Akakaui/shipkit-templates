# SKILL SCANNER

Last updated: 2026-06-26
Version: 1
Scope: OPEX (orchestrator)

## PURPOSE

Read the full arsenal of skill files, identify gaps,
and suggest new skills that should be created based on
what the system is missing.

## HOW IT WORKS

Step 1: Scan all files in .opex/skills/
Step 2: Read each skill's description and scope
Step 3: Compare against:
  - Active goals (what capabilities are needed)
  - Agent requirements (what skills agents reference)
  - Performance gaps (what's not working)
  - Tool availability (what tools exist but aren't skilled)

Step 4: Generate suggestions report

## SCAN OUTPUT FORMAT
